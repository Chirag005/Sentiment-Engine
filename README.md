Sentiment Engine

******************************************************************************************************
******************************************************************************************************

Sentiment Engine is an advanced multilingual sentiment analysis platform leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning to deliver accurate, 
real-time opinion insights. Supporting over eight major languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German, it uses the transformer-based 
XLM-RoBERTa model to achieve high accuracy across diverse linguistic contexts. To ensure reliability in resource-constrained environments, 
it incorporates a robust keyword-based fallback mechanism. The system features a clean, user-friendly web interface coupled with a scalable RESTful API 
backend built with Flask, enabling seamless integration with other applications. Real-time sentiment scoring is enhanced through a dynamic confidence meter, 
providing users transparent and interpretable confidence levels. Architected for scalability and extensibility, Sentiment Engine serves business analysts, 
developers, and researchers seeking actionable, multilingual sentiment detection for various domains such as market research, social media monitoring, 
and customer feedback analysis.

<img width="1407" height="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f025961-269d-4f27-ab31-ca8ed24357ae" />
Text: "The final pitch loomed, and the all-nighter seemed to have fried everyone's last brain cell, but when Sarah noticed a critical gap in Mark's data, instead of a flare-up, she saw a chance to collaborate. They quickly merged their expertise, turning the near-miss into the project's most compelling, data-backed insight. The next day, watching the client nod in genuine approval, the team realized the real win was the trust and synergy they'd built under pressure."
Detected Sentiment: Positive (Confidence: High, 0.298s)
Language: English (auto-detected)
UI: Vibrant positive emoji, green sentiment label, and confidence meter indicating robust detection
This example demonstrates a positive project outcome under pressure. Sentiment Engine accurately detects the uplifting tone, showing a smiling emoji and green positive label. The confidence meter fills strongly, giving businesses insights for positive feedback scenarios.



<img width="1403" height="634" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fc7ba09-d188-424e-be1d-16cbb6f3cc6d" />
Text: "The weather report indicates a 60% chance of precipitation for the afternoon. The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:00 PM in the main conference room. All required documents have been uploaded to the shared network folder."
Detected Sentiment: Neutral (Confidence: High, 0.35s)
Language: English (auto-detected)
UI: Neutral emoji, orange label, confidence meter placed near the center
Here, the analysis surfaces neutral, information-only text. The UI returns a neutral face and orange sentiment label, letting users know the communication is essentially unbiased, without emotional tilt. Processing remains rapid and fully transparent.




<img width="1405" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1ac43d2-3cf7-46c9-bb6b-f8d0fe921955" />
Text: "Despite weeks of effort, the project outline was still fundamentally flawed and lacked any original thought. The continuous delays ensured that they would never meet the deadline everyone had grudgingly agreed upon. Frankly, the entire presentation was a confusing mess and a complete waste of everyone's time."
Detected Sentiment: Negative (Confidence: High, 0.301s)
Language: English (auto-detected)
UI: Clear negative emoji, bold red label, confidence bar visualizes high certainty
This example displays a highly negative review. The interface quickly classifies the text and shows a negative emoji and red sentiment label, accompanied by a left-biased confidence bar. Both experts and non-experts can immediately gauge the overall emotion and reliability of the result.

Step  |  Input      |  Process              |  Output                                        
------+-------------+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------
1     |  Text       |  UI capture           |  Fetch API call (JSON)                         
2     |  JSON text  |  Flask API            |  Analyzer invoked                              
3     |  Text       |  Language detector    |  Language code (auto or user-select)           
4     |  Text+lang  |  XLM-RoBERTa/Keyword  |  Sentiment label and per-class probabilities   
5     |  Scores     |  Confidence logic     |  User-facing label + meter/percentage          
6     |  Result     |  UI rendering         |  Animated sentiment, confidence, language badge

Implementation Notes:

Text passes through cleaning and language detection.

If model is available: XLM-RoBERTa is used for deep context analysis.

If not: Keyword engine searches for positive/negative indicators in the appropriate language lexicon.

Response logic: Returns sentiment classification, a confidence value (0.0–1.0), detected language, and processing time.

Frontend: Fetches and displays all data with smooth responsiveness.

All errors (timeouts, missing models, bad input) get user-friendly messages and fallback where possible.
